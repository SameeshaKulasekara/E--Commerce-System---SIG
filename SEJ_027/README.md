## Project Description:

Everyone has a busy life these days with their daily jobs. As a result, they don't have much time to buy the items they want for their immediate needs. The best solution is e-commerce. E-commerce, also known as electronic commerce, is the exchange of goods and services as well as the sending of money and data over an electronic network, most commonly the internet. Therefore, we made the decision to create the e-commerce web application.
Our application has four functionalities: management of users' profiles and accounts, management of products, management of orders and management of Review. These functionalities must be managed by the admin. The customer must sign up for our system. After that, order goods, and add them to their shopping cart. They must ultimately pay for them. The customer can provide their feedback on our app as well. We also intended to design this as a COVID prevention. We can avoid COVID by buying and selling goods online. Therefore, we believe that our web application will provide better solutions for the aforementioned issues.
